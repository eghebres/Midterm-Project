# Midterm-Project

Since the Cold War ended in 1989, and East and West Germany has reunited, the discreptancy between East and West Germany has been a highly discussed issue within the country.
When it comes to political views, opinions on migration, the economy, infrastracture, education level, the division and decades of separation are still there. 
The German government has taken a lot of action into reuniting the country and supporting the 'new' states (East Germany) financially and providing infrastructure to improve life in the East.
Although the differences aren't as big as they once were, the measures haven't been fully successful yet.
Especially interesting is the difference in political views between East and West. I was interested in having a look at the trust level citizens of East and West Germany have. 
Is there a difference between the trust level citizens have in the East or West of Germany? Is there a connection between the years of full-time education and the trust people have in the government? How much time do people spend on consuming media related to news and politics? Etc.
